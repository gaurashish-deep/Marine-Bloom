# Marine-Bloom
CNN model selection for Bloom Identification and classification. Most prevalent image processing models like VGG-16, MobileNetV2, AlexNet, and ResNeXt has been applied for this classification. The models are implemented in Tensorflow, Keras, Jupyter Notebook.The VGG16,MobileNetV2,AlexNet and ResNeXt model has been implemented by using the [1,2,3,4].
